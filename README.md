Gqrx
====

Gqrx is an experimental software defined radio receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and Mac and supports the following devices:
- Funcube Dongle Pro and Pro+
- RTL2832U-based DVB-T dongles (rtlsdr via USB and TCP)
- OsmoSDR
- USRP
- HackRF Jawbreaker
- Nuand bladeRF
- any other device supported by the gr-osmosdr library

Gqrx can operate as a traditional AM/FM/SSB receiver with audio output or as an FFT-only instrument.


Download
--------

Gqrx is distributed as source code package and binaries for Linux and Mac. Please see http://gqrx.dk/download for a list of official and third party download resources.


Usage
-----

The first time you start gqrx it will open a device configuration dialog. Supported devices that are connected to the computer are discovered automatically and you can select any of them in the drop-down list.

If you don't see your device listed in the drop-down list it could be because:
- The driver has not included in a binary distribution
- The udev rule has not been properly configured

You can test your device first with rtl_test, qthid, or uhd_usrp_probe that come with the respective packages.

Gqrx supports multiple configurations and sessions if you have several devices or if you want to use the same device under different configurations. You can load a configuration from the GUI or using the -c command line argument. See "gqrx --help" for a complete list of command line arguments.

Installation from source
------------------------

The source code is hosted on Github: https://github.com/csete/gqrx

To compile gqrx from source you need the following dependencies:
- GNU Radio 3.7 with the following components:
    - gnuradio-runtime
    - gnuradio-analog
    - gnuradio-blocks
    - gnuradio-filter
    - gnuradio-fft
    - gnuradio-audio
- The gr-iqbalance library (optional)
- At least one of:
    - Funcube Dongle Pro driver via gnuradio-fcd
    - UHD driver via gnuradio-uhd
    - Funcube Dongle Pro+ driver from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus
    - RTL-SDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/
    - OsmoSDR driver from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/osmo-sdr/
    - HackRF Jawbreaker driver from http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/
- gnuradio-osmosdr from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/gr-osmosdr/
- pulseaudio (Linux only and optional)
- Qt 4.7 or later and optionally Qt Creator (gqrx works with Qt 5)

Gqrx comes with a simple qmake build setup. It can be compiled from within Qt Creator or in a terminal:

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/csete/gqrx.git gqrx.git
$ cd gqrx.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ qmake ..
$ make
</pre>

To build in debug mode add "CONFIG+=debug" to the qmake step above. There are also some other qmake options, see the gqrx.pro file.
